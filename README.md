# Summer-Training-Project

This project was part of my summer training with the Holy Capital Police, 
where I took on the role of a network engineer. The task assigned to me was to create a schematic model for a chosen facility and distribute network points, considering the room sizes and their contents. I opted to focus on the dispensary and strategically distribute the grid points accordingly. 

Please find the attached project for further details.
